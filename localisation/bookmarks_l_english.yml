 THENEWORDER_NAME:0 "The New Order"
 THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "A new order has descended upon the world. With the triumph of the Axis Powers in the Second World War, the world has been forever changed. Yesterday's great empires are now dust under the boot of today's victors. A German lands on the moon as Hitler fades. In America, the old system lies shattered. The Mediterranean's power balance lies on a knife's edge. China, little more then a slave of Japan, begins to transform itself. And in Russia, long-damned warlords realize their destiny."

 GER_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Once humbled by their failures in the Weltkrieg, Germany once more rose to prominence with the leadership of Adolf Hitler in the 1930s. Thanks to the failures of the Allies, WW2 has ended in complete German victory.\n\nGermany now presides over the most powerful Empire on Earth, but despite her victory, Germany's control remains tenuous at best. Wracked by an economic crash that has frozen the nation for a decade, and with a massive slave caste providing for the German people, the population has began to protest. The nation is now trapped in a series of student protests and the machinations of the Reichsbank."
